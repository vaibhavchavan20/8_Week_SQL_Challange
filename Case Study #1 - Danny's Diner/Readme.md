## 📑 Table of Contents

1. **Q1: What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**
```sql
SELECT
	sales.customer_id,
	SUM(menu.price) AS 'Total Spending in $'
FROM sales
INNER JOIN menu ON
	sales.product_id=menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY sales.customer_id;
```
| customer_id | Total Spending in $ |
|-------------|-------------|
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |


2. **Q2: How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**
```sql
SELECT
	customer_id,
	COUNT(DISTINCT(order_date)) AS days_visited
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
```
| customer_id | days_visited |
|-------------|--------------|
| A           | 4            |

3. **Q3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each Customer?**
```sql
SELECT 
	customer_id,
        product_name AS first_purchased_product
FROM
    (SELECT 
	sales.customer_id,
	menu.product_name,
	DENSE_RANK() OVER( PARTITION BY sales.customer_id ORDER BY sales.order_date) As rnk
      FROM sales
      INNER JOIN menu ON sales.product_id=menu.product_id) AS sales_rank
WHERE rnk = 1
GROUP BY customer_id,product_name;
```
| customer_id | first_purchased_product |

4. **Q4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?**
- This question needs to be solved in two parts, in part 1, we'll find the most purchased item and in part 2, we'll find how mny times its purchased by all customers
```sql
-- Part 1

SELECT 
	menu.product_name AS 'Most purchased Product',
	COUNT(sales.product_id) AS 'Purchase Count'
FROM sales 
INNER JOIN menu 
	ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY menu.product_name
ORDER BY COUNT(sales.product_id) DESC
LIMIT 1;                                           -- this gives the most purchased item on menu
```
| Most purchased Product | Purchase Count |
|---------------------|----------------|
| ramen               | 8              |

```sql
-- Part 2

SELECT 
	sales.customer_id,
	COUNT(sales.product_id) AS purchase_count
FROM sales
INNER JOIN menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
WHERE sales.product_id = (SELECT product_id FROM sales
			  GROUP BY product_id
			  ORdER BY count(product_id)
			  DESC LIMIT 1)
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY purchase_count DESC;                    -- this gives the list of customers who have purchased highest purchased item
```
| customer_id | purchase_count |
|-------------|----------------|
| A           | 3              |
| B           | 2              |

				   ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rnk
	FROM sales
	INNER JOIN menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
	GROUP BY sales.customer_id, menu.product_name )
SELECT 
	customer_id,
	product_name,
	purchase_count
FROM cte_popular_products
WHERE rnk=1;
```

		ELSE 
			CASE WHEN menu.product_name = 'sushi' THEN menu.price * 20
			ELSE menu.price * 10
			END
		END) AS points
FROM sales
INNER JOIN menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
INNER JOIN members ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
WHERE sales.order_date <= '2021-01-31'
AND sales.customer_id IN ('A','B')

```
| customer_id | total_price | points |

**Bonus Questions:
Q1. Join All The Things 
Recreate the table with columns:
customer_id, order_date, product_name, price, member_status (Y/N)**

```sql
SELECT 
  sales.customer_id, 
  sales.order_date,  
  menu.product_name, 
  menu.price,
  CASE
    WHEN sales.order_date >= members.join_date THEN 'Y'
    ELSE 'N' END AS member_status
FROM sales
LEFT JOIN members
  ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
INNER JOIN menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
ORDER BY members.customer_id;
```
| customer_id | order_date  | product_name | price | member_status |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|-------|---------------|
| A           | 2021-01-01  | sushi        | 10    | N             |

**Q2. Rank All The Things
Danny also requires further information about the ranking of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases, so he expects null ranking values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.**
```sql
 WITH cte_all_joined AS (
    SELECT
        s.customer_id,
        s.order_date AS order_date,
        m.product_name,
        m.price,
        CASE
            WHEN s.customer_id IS NOT NULL
                 AND s.order_date >= mm.join_date THEN 'Y'
            ELSE 'N'
        END AS member_status
    FROM sales s
    INNER JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
    LEFT JOIN members mm ON s.customer_id = mm.customer_id
)
SELECT
    *,
    CASE
        WHEN member_status = 'Y' THEN
            DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date)
        ELSE
            NULL
    END AS ranking
FROM
    cte_all_joined
ORDER BY
