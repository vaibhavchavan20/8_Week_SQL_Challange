1. **Q1: What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**
```sql
SELECT
sales.customer_id,
SUM(menu.price) AS 'Total Spending in $'
FROM sales
INNER JOIN menu ON
sales.product_id=menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY sales.customer_id;
```
| customer_id | Total Spending in $ |
|-------------|-------------|
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |


2. **Q2: How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**
```sql
SELECT
	customer_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT(order_date)) AS days_visited
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
```
| customer_id | days_visited |
|-------------|--------------|
| A           | 4            |

3. **Q3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each Customer?**
```sql
SELECT 
		customer_id,
        product_name AS first_purchased_product
FROM
    (SELECT 
		sales.customer_id,
		menu.product_name,
		DENSE_RANK() OVER( PARTITION BY sales.customer_id ORDER BY sales.order_date) As rnk
	FROM sales
	INNER JOIN menu ON sales.product_id=menu.product_id) AS sales_rank
WHERE rnk = 1
GROUP BY customer_id,product_name;
```

4. **Q4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?**
- This question needs to be solved in two parts, in part 1, we'll find the most purchased item and in part 2, we'll find how mny times its purchased by all customers
```sql
-- Part 1

SELECT 
	menu.product_name AS 'Most purchased Product',
    COUNT(sales.product_id) AS 'Purchase Count'
FROM sales 
INNER JOIN menu 
	ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY menu.product_name
ORDER BY COUNT(sales.product_id) DESC
LIMIT 1;                                           -- this gives the most purchased item on menu
```
| Most purchased Product | Purchase Count |
|---------------------|----------------|
| ramen               | 8              |

```sql
-- Part 2

SELECT 
	sales.customer_id,
    COUNT(sales.product_id) AS purchase_count
FROM sales
INNER JOIN menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
WHERE sales.product_id = (SELECT product_id FROM sales
							GROUP BY product_id
                            ORdER BY count(product_id)
                            DESC LIMIT 1)
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY purchase_count DESC;                    -- this gives the list of customers who have purchased highest purchased item
```
| customer_id | purchase_count |
|-------------|----------------|
| A           | 3              |
| B           | 2              |

		DENSE_RANK() OVER( PARTITION BY sales.customer_id 
						ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rnk
	FROM sales
	INNER JOIN menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
	GROUP BY sales.customer_id, menu.product_name )

	sales.customer_id,
    SUM(menu.price) AS total_price,
    SUM(CASE

			ELSE 
				CASE WHEN menu.product_name = 'sushi' THEN menu.price * 20
				ELSE menu.price * 10
				END
			END) AS points
FROM sales
INNER JOIN menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
INNER JOIN members ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
WHERE sales.order_date <= '2021-01-31'

GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY sales.customer_id;
```
| customer_id | total_price | points |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| A           | 76          | 1370   |
